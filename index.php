			<h2>Commander Riker Says:</h2>
			<p>Talk about going nowhere fast. I'd like to think that I haven't changed those things, sir. Mr. Crusher, ready a collision course with the Borg ship. I recommend you don't fire until you're within 40,000 kilometers. Maybe if we felt any human loss as keenly as we feel one of those close to us, human history would be far less bloody. The unexpected is our normal routine. What's a knock-out like you doing in a computer-generated gin joint like this?</p>
